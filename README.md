# Full-stack Portfolio Project

This project is designed to test all of the skills you've learned so far. By the end of this project, you should have a portfolio-ready project you can share on your resume as well as with potential employers.

This project will:

- Have a deployed back-end application.
- Have a deployed front-end application.
- Have a database with one or more tables.
- Have a theme and unique product design.

## Proposal:
I am creating a writing app where people can post their writing. 

**USER STORIES**

1. As a User, I will be greeted by a log-in modal on the landing page that asks for email, password or signup. 

> If user does not have an account they will be redirected to sign up giving their username, email, and password. If they do have an account they will be navigated to the home page. 

2. As a User, I will see several useful articles on display as well as a button that navigates the user to a create page or (write section) where they can create, post, edit and delete articles. 

3. As a User, I will be able to click and read the articles available. 

4. As a User, I can utilize the search bar on the home page to find as well as filter articles by topics.

**Stretch features**

1. As a User, when navigated to the create page, I will be taken to a form that counts words entered as well as suggests synonyms from a dictionary API while writing

1. As a user, I will be able to log in to my account which allows me to edit and delete only my work. 

1. As a user, I can bookmark works that I enjoy. 

1. As a user, I will be navigated to a TOS upon signup that suggests against copy infringement and protects admin from legal. 

1. As a user pronouns will be available on profile. 

1. As a user, I will see a comment, like, and view feature.
